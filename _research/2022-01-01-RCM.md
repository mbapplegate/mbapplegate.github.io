title: Machine learning for imaging skin cancer with reflectance confocal microscopy
excerpt: "Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive optical imaging modality capable of achieving cellular resolution that is currently used to rapidly diagnose skin cancer. I'm working on developing machine learning algorithms that will make it possible for the next generation of RCM microscopes smaller, faster, and cheaper.

RCM is currently being used in the clinic to assess skin cancer margins as well as provide diagnosis. RCM can optically section a sample which allows the cellular structure to be seen without any contributions from tissue outside of the plane of focus. Thin optical sections require the use of high-NA objectives which are complex, heavy, and expensive. My hope is that, by using AI, thick optical sections collected with small, inexpensive optics, can be sharpened to produce images similar to those obtainable with high numerical aperture.
