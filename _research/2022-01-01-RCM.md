title: Machine learning for imaging skin cancer with reflectance confocal microscopy
excerpt: "Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive optical imaging modality capable of achieving cellular resolution that is currently used to rapidly diagnose skin cancer. I'm working on developing machine learning algorithms that will make it possible for the next generation of RCM microscopes smaller, faster, and cheaper. <br/><img src="/images/exampleRCMImage.png" width="400" height="400" alt="RCM image of healthy skin"><br/>"
