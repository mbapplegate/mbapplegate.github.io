title: 3D micropatterning silk hydrogels via three-photon absorption
excerpt: "No cell in your body is more than a few hundreds of microns from a blood vessel. A key challenge for artificial organs is developing a biomimetic vasculature to support cell growth. In this work I used the large three-photon absorption cross section of silk fibroin to generate 3D structures in silk hydrogels that range in size from a few microns up to nearly a millimeter at unprecedented depths"

Optical tools are great at delivering energy to a precise location in time and space. Here I took advantage of the large three-photon cross-section of silk to carve vessel-like structures. I seeded these structures with cells and demonstrated that they could take advantage of the voids created to penetrate deeply within the hydrogel. The goal for this work is to one day use these patterns to feed cells in artificial organs.
