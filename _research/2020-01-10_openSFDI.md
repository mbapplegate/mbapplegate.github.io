Reading papers can teach you all about the theory of an imaging system and its performance. However, it's very hard to learn "tricks of the trade" from the literature. Usually they
are learned from a mentor or by trial and error. My first SFDI system took me about 6 months to build. The second I was able to get done in about 6 weeks. And the third in about 6 days.
Here, I tried to distill that experience and make it easier for everyone to build one of these systems.
