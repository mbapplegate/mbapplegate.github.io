title: Multi-distance diffuse optical spectroscopy with a single optode via hypotrochoidal scanning
excerpt: "In diffuse optical spectroscopy, the distance between the source and detector fiber determines how deep below the surface detected light has traveled. Longer separation is more sensitive to deeper structures, while short separation is more sensitive to superficial changes. Many instruments rely on an array of different sources and detectors to build up 3D estimates of tissue hemoglobin. Here, I use mechanical scanning to trace the source and detector through a hypotrochoid which allows for a range of source/detector separations that are all centered at the same location. This allows measurements to form a pseudo axial line scan to build up 2- and 3-dimensional images of tissue chromophores."

This work was inspired by the teacup rides common in amusement parks that send riders around in small circles while also traversing a larger circle. This pattern is called a [hypotrochoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid) and has a number of unique properties: 1) A single actuator can drive an optical fiber along a hypotrochoidal path. 2) Two fibers on separate hypotrochoids will have a range of separations. 3) The center point between the two fibers will always be at a common location. These properties make it possible to assign depths to each measurement and produce a rough approximation of a 3D image when the probe is scanned over the surface of tissue.
